# single_port_ram_asynchronus_read-write
This repository contains a Verilog HDL implementation of a Single-Port RAM with asynchronous read and asynchronous write capabilities. The design provides a compact and efficient memory block suitable for ASIC projects, small processors, buffers, lookup tables, and embedded systems.
